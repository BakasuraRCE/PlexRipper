Which is why there are some safe guards in place to protect Plex Ripper users from being banned by Plex. However, be respectful to Plex server owners by not taking up all their precious bandwidth and don't complain to me about being kicked of a server. In the future I would also like to protect Plex server owners from Plex Ripper abuse, any ideas or input are welcome."
